In the House Hold Builder interface there are four buttons. When you enter the values in the forms, input and dropdown list 
of age and relationship, you will see an alert if no values are put in. That is an alert for each. You will enter the values
and press enter then submit and then add if you want to add another person but the process is the same.

First you enter the values.  
Then you have to press add to add it to the display.  
the values will be displayed below the title in an ordered list starting from one.
when you press add then you can add another person or submit values to the server. 
When you submit the values the values will be displayed in an array in a jSON stringify method. 
This will then be ready to be used as data on the server side.
